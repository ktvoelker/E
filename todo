To-Do
=====

Figure out which built-ins behave like functions (and can thus be exposed as library
functions) and which have special semantics

Define the semantics of static argument inference and function name overloading

  These are somewhat in opposition if overloads are allowed to have differing numbers
  of parameters.

Implement the compiler

Implement the documentation generator
