Add support for unsafe operations to the grammar.

  Along with this, provide more succinct syntax for pointer operations, including
  safe ones. This will obviate the need for mutable local variables: you can define
  a pointer to a memory cell instead. Make sure array access is unified under this
  notion of pointers, as well.

Translate the informal grammar into an ANTLR grammar.

  Challenges are:
    
    Figuring out how to translate sep_list and sep_list_1.

    Fixing conflicts.

    Adding a list of operators with precedences.

Make the ANTLR grammar produce a Java AST value.
