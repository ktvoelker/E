The Compiler
============

 1. Local static checks (basic invariants that are logically syntactic)

 2. Import resolution (find the modules, compile them if necessary, check for symbols)

 3. Name resolution (fully qualify all names and distinguish different kinds of lookups)

 4. Type checking, static argument inference, and static function dispatch

    It is an error if there are multiple definitions with the same dynamic parameters
    and the same number of static parameters.

 5. Recursive tail call optimization (produce while loops)

 6. Control simplification (replace imperative control structures with gotos)

 7. High-level optimization passes

 8. Conversion to system-independent three-address code

 9. Mid-level optimization passes

10. Conversion to system assembly

11. Low-level optimization passes

12. Conversion to machine code
